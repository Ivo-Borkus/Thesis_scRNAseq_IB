# Repository for the thesis of Ivo Borkus at the Single-cell Group (CNAG)

This repository contains all scripts that were used to:
1. Process the data
2. Annotate and interpret the data (such as a folder with used signatures)
3. Generate figures (With seperate scripts for each figure)
Lastly, there is a file that summarises the versions of main packages used in the scripts.
